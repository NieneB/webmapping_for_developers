# Web mapping for web developers


The team from [Webmapper](http://www.webmapper.nl "What the map can be") developed this workshop in the context of the event ['Are you following me?'](https://waag.org/nl/event/are-you-following-me) to share their hands-on experience in web cartography and geographic web application development. The workshop has been given for several conferences and meetups.

## Short outline of the workshop

We will work with **raster tiles** in Leaflet. Starting from a simple **web** map and moving further into the **GIS** world with every step. 

1. In [Leaflet part 1](https://github.com/NieneB/webmapping_for_developers/wiki/Leaflet-part-1) we will set up a Leaflet map and learn about the different options and settings.
2. In [Leaflet part 2](https://github.com/NieneB/webmapping_for_developers/wiki/Leaflet-part-2) we will add custom data to our basemap. In the form op a marker, icon, circle, polygon or small GeoJSON dataset. 
3. in [Leaflet part 3](https://github.com/NieneB/webmapping_for_developers/wiki/Leaflet-part-3) we will change the projection of the map and add some WMS layers.
3. in [Leaflet part 4](https://github.com/NieneB/webmapping_for_developers/wiki/Leaflet-part-4) we will add GeoJSON data and a WFS to the map and use some data driven styling. 

We will work with **vector tiles** in MapboxGL. Setting up a basic map, manipulating the style with JavaScript and designing our own style object.  

1. [MapboxGL part 1](https://github.com/NieneB/webmapping_for_developers/wiki/MapboxGL-part-1) let's us set up a simple map with mapbox as a provider. 
2. [MapboxGL part 2](https://github.com/NieneB/webmapping_for_developers/wiki/MapboxGL-part-2) we will move to custom tiles and learn how to make the map interactive and make small changes to the style with javascript.
3. [MapboxGL part 3](https://github.com/NieneB/webmapping_for_developers/wiki/MapboxGL-part-3) shows you how to start working on your own style json file based on the Mapbox GL styling specs.
