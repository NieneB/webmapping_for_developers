## Short outline of the workshop

We will work with **raster tiles** in Leaflet. Starting from a simple **web** map and moving further into the **GIS** world with every step. 

1. Leaflet part 1 we will set up a Leaflet map and learn about the different options and settings.
2. In Leaflet part 2 we will add custom data to our basemap. In the form op a marker, icon, circle, polygon or small GeoJSON dataset. 
3. in Leaflet part 3 we will change the projection of the map and add some WMS layers.
3. in Leaflet part 4 we will add GeoJSON data and a WFS to the map and use some data driven styling. 

MapboxGL provides us custom maps with **vector tiles**.

1. MapboxGL part 1 let's us set up a simple map with mapbox as a provider. 
2. MapboxGL part 2 we will move to custom tiles and learn how to make the map interactive and make small changes to the style with javascript.
3. MapboxGL part 3 shows you how to start working on your own style json file based on the Mapbox GL styling specs.
